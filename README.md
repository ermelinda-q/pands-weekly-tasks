#### Weekly tasks
##### *Author: Ermelinda Qejvani*

This repository contains all weekly tasks required for 'Programming and Scripting' module.

***

__Week 1__

This is my first program in python. It prints out 'Hello World'

Filename: [helloworld.py](./helloworld.py)

***

__Week 2 - Statements__

Filename: [bank.py](./bank.py)

Task: Write a program that should:
1. Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
2. Add the two amounts
3. Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount

__Week 3 - Variables__

Filename: [accounts.py](./accounts.py)

Task: Write a program that:
1. Reads in a 10 character account number
2. Outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs
3. Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length

__Week 4 - Controlling the flow__

Filename: [collatz.py](./collatz.py)

Task: Write a program that:
1. Asks the user to input any positive integer
2. Outputs the successive values of the following calculations
    - At each step calculate next value by taking the current value and:
        1. if even divide it by two
        2. if odd multiply it by three and add one.
3. Have the program end if the current value is one.

__Week 5 - Data__

Filename: [weekday.py](./weekday.py)

Task: Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.

This program will display:
1. the day of the week, date, month, year
2. Depending on the day of the week, it will also display one of the following messages:
    - 'Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday!' or 
    - 'It is the weekend, yay!'

__Week 6 - Functions__

Filename: [squareroot.py](./squareroot.py)

Task: Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

This program will:
1. Create my own function called sqrt() that finds the square root of the float number.
2. Should be based on Newton's method of estimating square roots.

__Week 7 - Files__

Filename: [es.py](./es.py)

Task: This program reads a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.
1. The file name 'week7.txt' should be given as a second argument in command line after the es.py file
2. First we check the length of the argument read on the command line
3. In order for the program to read how many e's are in the file be two arguments:
     - es.py - our program file
     - week7.txt - file to read
